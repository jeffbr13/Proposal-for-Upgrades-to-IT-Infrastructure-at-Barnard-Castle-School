##To generate PDF after changes to source:##

You first need to have some form of [LateX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) installed on your computer, texlive
for instance. Then in the directory with the report source file, run

    pdflatex "./Initial Proposal.tex"

You can just delete the extra files generated, as all you need to keep are
the source and pdf file.
