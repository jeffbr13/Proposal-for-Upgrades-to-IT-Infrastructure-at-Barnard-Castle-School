\section{Executive Summary}

Barnard Castle School risks slipping further and further behind in it's
IT infrastructure and policy.
Without a clear and decisive plan, this risk will become a reality, putting
the school at a practical and commercial disadvantage.


For years, other schools\footnote{\href{http://www.sedberghschool.org/ict.html}{Sedbergh School}} 
% TODO: Need more examples for this, see Rev.
have been upgrading their equipment, and building extensible infrastructure
whilst we have lingered with a proprietary, inflexible, and expensive system of
computers upgraded piecemeal or not at all.


The school's current systems and infrastructure is insufficient for current
needs, and will not scale to meet the future's either.
There needs to be a greater focus on creating a more sustainable and flexible
policy that will scale with the school, it's students, and their teachers, into
the future.


We the academic council, and all the members of the student body who have signed
the attached petition propose that the school focuses it's resources on building
a secure and flexible network environment that allows users to connect to the
internet, each other, and school resources in a controlled and efficient manner.
Such a network would include WiFi access to everyone, on their own laptops and
other equipment, and hopefully an upgrade 


By being allowed to use our own equipment, we believe that an open network will
aid communication and learning amongst the staff and students, and that by
applying less direct restrictions the experience of using a computer in the
school will have less friction and probably even cost less in the long term.


The methodology and software exists, is mature, and is well-tested. This has been
attempted before, successfully, in many other environments and schools. BCS will
not be alone in stepping into the future.



\section{Rationale}


If, rather than concentrating on having enough computers for people--which we
never have, due to a substantial proportion of them being broken, in some way,
at any one time--we instead build a network that allows people to attach their
own equipment, be it a laptop, tablet, or e-reader.

Specifically we propose:
    
\begin{description}

\item[Wireless internet and network access] for everyone.
\item[School accounts] to remain for file storage, printing and email, and for
the use of the remaining school computers.
\item[Faster internet connection] for the school.


\end{description}


The school currently spends a great deal of money on a patchwork of ICT
service contracts, leases, and software licences.
Much of the software we pay RM for is freely available by design, while we pay
a huge deal for the privelige of having their badge on commodity components.
In addition, our current system requires a great deal of upkeep relative to
what we pay for it all. In buying so much of our infrastructure pre-assembled
(poorly) from a third party, we have ended up with an overly complicated and
expensive system.

% Is this stuff too aggressive? Should we open with more of a pro-future-plans rather than anti-present spiel?

Boarders are unable to remain in contact with their parents nearly as much
as at other schools. If Skype and internet messaging services are free, why
would they pay for international phone calls? At the same time though, students
must sit in their housemaster's office to have private conversations with their
relations. This is a less than ideal situation.

Those who want unfettered access to the internet (i.e. all of them) are
able to gain it quite easily, using a 3G dongle or simply walking to the NEST
cafe down the road. By giving them partially restriced access to the internet,
they are unlikely to spend much more energy or money getting at the small part
they can't access in school.


The school email system is used heavily by the staff, and is very useful, but
almost no students use it, or even know it exists.
The ability to store files at school is a useful one, as is accessing them from
home. But the amount of space offered is pitiful in this day and age, and it is
impossible to log on through the internet access feature.
Pupils log on at school primarily to use the printers, which are a tremendously
useful resource, but apart from that, most prefer to work at home as much as is
practical.


Software at the school is often out of date, and therefore insecure.
Internet Explorer on the computers is the primary offender, as not only is it
a known attack vector for harmful programs and crackers, but it is slow and
prone to crashing, taking a student's work with it. Because of misconfiguration,
the homepage for most of the school is set to the security software's website,
and many don't know how to get back to the intranet page. UCAS login is
inaccessible outside of M Block because of misconfiguration, too. Memory Map
(used for Duke of Edinburgh's Award groups) has disappeared from the school's
computers.


Equipment upkeep is poor. Outside of the M Block (or even the
technicians' eyeline) the state of the computers quickly declines to be near
unusable. 'Warm-up' times can exceed five minutes. Ports, keyboards, or screens
might not work, or entire terminals may refuse to even turn on.
Students feel little need to look after equipment that A) is not theirs,
and B) doesn't usually work anyway. The purpose of ICT is to enable
people to work and communicate faster, not to impede and distract them as it
often does now. The computer rooms under the direct jurisdiction of the
technicians are as a rule well-kept, but the space in Main School could be
better used for other purposes--a student meeting room perhaps.


The complexity of dealing with all of these problems is too much for such a
small IT team to handle, and a larger one cannot be justified in a school of
this size.


To deal with this, Barnard Castle School's infrastructure can be simplified
so that it is better adapted for how it is actually used, whilst being more
readily expandable for the future.




\section{Methodology}


As previously mentioned, none of the systems required are new or even
experimental. They are well-tested and used in diverse and challenging
situations.

\subsection{Faster Internet Connection}

% Short Rationale again

% Pros/Cons
This is the easiest part of the proposal to implement, and could be dropped
into the current system wholesale, with no further changes. However, as you will
already know, this is likely to be very expensive.
% TODO: Get ballpark figures


This involves the school paying to lay it's own cables to the nearest exhange
to guarantee fast access.


% Alternatives?
If the school were to approach other businesses in the local area (specifically
NEST Cafe) then it may be able to share the costs and the benefits of the
improved infrastructure with the local area.


% Rationale, AGAIN
The advantage of laying our own lines is that not only is it a simple upgrade
for the entire campus, but it will future-proof the school with regards to
internet access, putting us at the forefront of technology for the foreseeable
future.
